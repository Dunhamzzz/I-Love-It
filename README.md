URL Shortener script for http://ilo.ve.it

Originally, the plan was to knock out an URL shortner script with the absolute minimum response size with inspiration from the source code of Googles 404 page.

Now I've decided to take a bit more pride in the output, so I'm extending out the markup to use readable class names, files names etc.

Feel free to use/fork/contribute.
